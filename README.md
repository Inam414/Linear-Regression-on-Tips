# Linear-Regression-on-Tips
A Simple Linear Regression model to analyze the tips dataset from a restaurant, aiming to understand how various factors influence the tips given by customers.

# Project Highlights:

Used the well-known tips dataset from Seaborn.
Included all relevant factors such as total bill, sex, smoker status, day, time, and party size.

Process Followed:

- Ensured there were no missing values or outliers.

- Created scatter plots and box plots to explore relationships between variables.

- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

- Split the data into training and testing sets, and built a Simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

- Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
